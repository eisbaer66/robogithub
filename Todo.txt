  Priority:
  1. Add Back button to all menu levels.
  2. Add counter for Tank, Engineer and Sentry Buster
  

1. Need time passed resource added (opposite of time remaining)
 Type A- Resource for X amount of time passed, is available after X amount of time has passed
 Type B - Resource for Y amount of time passed in a loop. Becomes unavailable when picked, and only available once Y amount of time has passed again
Example A: Pan Cop becomes available after 180 seconds of gametime has passed, can be picked again
Example B: Gotham Protector becomes available after 60 seconds of gametime, but can't be picked until another 60 seconds has passed after his death or switching of robot.

Every 4 player is one robot, rounding to floor. (better scaling sometimes?)

Bugs:
Become Human Robot:
1. Volunteer and get selected as robot
2. Retry in console
3. Volunteer - You now become robot on human team.
4. Volunteer again, you now get moved to the correct team.

If you mash boss menu button you revert back to human

Sometimes a player who is a robot, but disconnects gets autobalanced to the other team

Somteimes, selecting a robot doesn't close the menu.

storage:
 - turn target into targetlist in storage plugin? ... maybe? 
   needed in command too so it would be duplicate code
     unless command gets setup in main-plugin too?
